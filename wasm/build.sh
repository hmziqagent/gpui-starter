# Build the web (wasm32-unknown-unknown) artifact into wasm/pkg/.
#
#   wasm/build.sh            debug build (fast, huge, fine for development)
#   wasm/build.sh --release  release build (slow: 30-60 min for the gpui graph;
#                            run when a smaller artifact is needed)
#
# Steps: (1) cargo +nightly build of the lib cdylib (NIGHTLY is mandatory:
# wasm_thread uses `#![feature(stdarch_wasm_atomic_wait)]`), (2) wasm-bindgen
# --target web post-processing into wasm/pkg/ next to index.html.
#
# The wasm-bindgen CLI version MUST match the crate's wasm-bindgen pin
# (=0.2.125 in Cargo.toml) or the post-process fails with schema errors.
# Both profiles finish by writing wasm/pkg/version.json with a null
# version (200 for the harness boot probe, SW stays in dev no-op).
# Acquire the pinned CLI from GitHub release assets:
#   https://github.com/wasm-bindgen/wasm-bindgen/releases/download/0.2.125/ \
#     wasm-bindgen-0.2.125-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz
# (the release asset is named `wasm-bindgen-…`, not `wasm-bindgen-cli-…`).
#
# --release additionally runs wasm-opt (binaryen) over the bindgen output.
# Acquire the pinned binaryen from GitHub release assets (~seconds):
#   https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/releases/download/version_123/ \
#     binaryen-version_123-x86_64-linux.tar.gz
#   -> extract bin/wasm-opt to ~/.local/bin. Missing binary = warning +
#   unoptimized artifact (the step is skippable; set WASM_OPT to override).
